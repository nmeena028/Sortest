📌 Overview
This project is a metro route planning tool that calculates the shortest path between metro stations using Dijkstra's algorithm. Designed to enhance public transit efficiency, the system can be integrated with online ticketing systems to optimize travel planning and reduce commuter hassle

Tech: Java, Dijkstra Algorithm, MySQL
•	Developed a tool to compute the shortest path between metro stations.
•	Proposed integration with online ticketing for public transit.
 Shortest Distance Calculation System
Tech Stack: Java, Dijkstra Algorithm, MySQL

🎯 Features
✅ Shortest Path Calculation: Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the minimum distance between any two metro stations efficiently.
✅ User-Friendly Input: Allows users to select source and destination stations for real-time distance computation.
✅ Scalable Design: Built with modular Java classes for easy future integration with route management or ticketing systems.
✅ Database Integration: Stores station data and routes using MySQL for persistent data management.
✅ Extendable for Ticketing: Can be extended to calculate fare estimates and ticket generation based on shortest distance.

🛠️ Tech Details
Java: Core logic, data structures, and algorithm implementation.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm: For graph-based shortest path calculation.

MySQL: For managing metro stations and routes persistently.

🚀 Potential Future Enhancements
Integration with online ticketing and fare calculation systems.

GUI or web interface for public use.

Real-time traffic and congestion analysis for dynamic route adjustment.

Multi-route suggestion with time and cost estimation.

🖥️ How It Works
1️⃣ User inputs source and destination stations.
2️⃣ The system fetches data from MySQL and represents the metro map as a weighted graph.
3️⃣ Dijkstra's algorithm computes the minimum distance and route.
4️⃣ The system outputs the shortest path and distance to the user.
